DESCRIPTION -
	     TIMEZONE:
	     This file sets the time zone environment  variable  TZ,  and
	     the  locale-related  environment variables LANG, LC_COLLATE,
	     LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY, LC_NUMERIC, and LC_TIME.
	     stdio:
	     A file with associated buffering is  called  a  stream  (see
	     intro(3))  and is declared to be a pointer to a defined type
	     FILE.  fopen() creates certain descriptive data for a stream
	     and returns a pointer to designate the stream in all further
	     transactions.  Normally, there are three open  streams  with
	     constant pointers declared in the <stdio.h> header and asso-
	     ciated with the standard open files:
	     date:
	     The date utility writes the date and time to standard output
	     or  attempts  to  set the system date and time.  By default,
	     the current date and time will be written.
	     NOTES:
	     If you attempt to set the current date to one of  the  dates
	     that the standard and alternate time zones change (for exam-
	     ple, the date that daylight time is starting or ending), and
	     you  attempt  to  set  the  time  to  a time in the interval
	     between the end of standard time and the  beginning  of  the
	     alternate  time  (or  the  end of the alternate time and the
	     beginning of standard time), the results are unpredictable.

RUNNING DEMO -
	     Place the setTimeOfDay.c file in your <Tornado> dir. 
	     Depending on the target you have, define the CPU in
	     your compile line and use the Makefile in the 
	     BSP dir. to compile.
             
	     #define TIME_ENV "TIMEZONE = PST:PDT:480:040202:101502"
	     As part of the work-around, set PDT start and stop times to be
	     the gmt times that PDT starts and stops locally.

	     To run this code invoke the function rdate() followed by date().
