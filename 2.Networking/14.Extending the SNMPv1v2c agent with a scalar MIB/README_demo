DESCRIPTION -
              This demo shows how to do a MIB extension to the SNMP agent 
              using a scalar custom MIB. This example is described in the 
              SNMPv1/v2c Component Release Supplement 1.0 Chapter 6 -
              Extending the WindNet SNMPv1/v2c Agent.
              Use the 6 steps provided in the chapter to make the MIB 
              extension.  The Makefile in the /snmpv1/agent/ dir has
              been edited to Makefile.demo to include demo.mib and demo.o
              Do a "make clean" in your agent and vxWorks image dir
              before you build a new SNMP agent and integrage it to VxWorks.
