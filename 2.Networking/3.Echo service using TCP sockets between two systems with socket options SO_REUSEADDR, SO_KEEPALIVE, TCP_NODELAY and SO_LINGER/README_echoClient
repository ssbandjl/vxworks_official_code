             echoClient.c

DESCRIPTION - 
	     The TCP echo client repeatedly sends the input and then reads 
             it back using TCP socket communication.

	     ECHO services are important tools that network managers use 
             to test reachability (to make sure the connection works), 
             debug protocol software, and identify routing problems.

	     This also demonstrates the usage of SO_REUSEADDR, 
             SO_KEEPALIVE and TCP_NODELAY set socket options.

RUNNING DEMO -
	     You need to set/change the value of the defaultPort 
             (should be greater than 5000 - unreserved port) and the 
             defaultServer (internet address of the echo server) variables.

	     Run echoTcpClientRun task on one VxWorks system as follows
	     after starting the echoTcpServerRun task from 
             another VxWorks system.
	     The other half of the demonstration is in echoServer.c.

	     Place the echoClient.c file in your
	     <Tornado> dir. Depending on the target
	     you have, define the CPU in your compile line and use
	     the Makefile in the BSP dir. to compile.

	     To run this code invoke the function echoTcpClientRun()

TESTED ON -  Host/Target : Solaris 2.5.1 /mv1604
	     VxWorks     : 5.3.1
